Notice: For security purpose, all the files needed are under "master" branch.


### Brief Introduction:

In this project, I use data-driven approaches such as linear optimization (with Gurobipy in Python) and interative dashboard (with Plotly in Python) to help users control the inject of calories and live a better and healthier life. 

The dashboard has 3 tabs. For the first tab, I use Python to collect info of fast food restaurants and their corresponding menus from unofficial website, and combining with usersâ€™ choices, present total calories and other nutritions they take with various tables and charts. For the second tab, based on the results of the first tab, users' preferences of exercises and maximum time they can allocate to exercise, I construct an abstract linear optimization function with gurobi package in Python and provide them the optimized combination of exercises. For the last tab, I design a table that includes additional information about the calories of fast food. This project includes whole steps of data processing: web scraping, data cleaning, data exploring, data analysis, data modeling and data visualization.
